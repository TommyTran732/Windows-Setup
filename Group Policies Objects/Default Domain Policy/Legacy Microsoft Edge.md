# Legacy Microsoft Edge

`Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Microsoft Edge`

**Legacy Microsoft Edge, not the Chromium based one. Obsolete.**

- Allow Address bar drop-down list suggestions -> Disabled
- Configure Autofill -> Disabled (Password Manager is off so no reason for autofill to be on)
- Configure Do Not Track -> Enabled
- Allow Extensions -> Disabled (I do not use extensions, and they reduce security in a lot of cases. Don't disable this if you need extensions, of course.)
- Allow Adobe Flash -> Disabled (Dead technology, dangerous)
- Configure Password Manager -> Disabled (**The password manager does NOT have E2EE**)
- Configure Windows Defender SmartScreen -> Disabled
- Allow extended telemetry for the Books tab -> Disabled
- Prevent using Localhost IP address for WebRTC -> Enabled
- Prevent Microsoft Edge from gather Live Tile information when pinning a site to Start
