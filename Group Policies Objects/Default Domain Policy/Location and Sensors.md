# Location and Sensors

`Computer Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Location and Sensors`

I do not see these ever being used on my system, therefore they are disabled. Obviously, you don't have to apply them if you want to use location and sensors.

- Turn off location scripting -> Enabled
- Turn off location -> Enabled
- Turn off sensors -> Enabled
