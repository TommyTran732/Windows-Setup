# Start Menu and Taskbar

`Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Start Menu and Taskbar`

This is not strictly problematic, though I get quite irritated with most used apps/recently added apps/recently opened documents/etc showing up on my start menu. Someone may inadvertently see something when I show them my screen.

- Remove "Recently added" list from Start Menu -> Enabled
- Remove Personalized Website Recommendation section in the Start Menu -> Enabled
- Remove Recommended section from Start Menu -> Enabled
- Remove frequent program list from Start Menu -> Enabled
- Do not keep history of recently opened documents -> Enabled
- Show or hide "Most used" list from Start menu -> Enabled -> Hide
- Pin Apps to Start when installed -> Disabled
