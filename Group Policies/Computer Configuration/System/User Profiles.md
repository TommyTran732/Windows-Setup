# User Profiles

`Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\System\User Profiles`

- Turn off the advertising ID -> Enabled
- Only allow local user profiles -> Enabled (You probably aren't going to use roaming profiles unless you are in some niche environment like a university, are you? Might as well just disable them because why not?)
