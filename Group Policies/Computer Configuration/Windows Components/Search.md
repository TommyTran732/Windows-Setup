`Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Search`

Very confusing, you need to consult https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/privacy/manage-connections-from-windows-operating-system-components-to-microsoft-services#21-cortana-and-search-group-policies

"Do not allow web search" looks old and probably deprecated, but Microsoft's docs still mention it for some reason. Thus, I am also going over other similar old settings for safe measure.

- Allow Cloud Search -> Disabled
- Allow Cortana -> Disabled
- Allow search and Cortana to use location -> Disabled
- Configures search on the taskbar -> Enabled -> Search icon and label (Not a privacy/security issue or anything, but I hate the gigantic box)
- Do not allow web search -> Enabled
- Don't search the web or display web results in Search -> Enabled
- Enable indexing of online delegate mailboxes -> Disabled
- Prevent indexing Microsoft Office Outlook -> Enabled
